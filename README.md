# django-rest
### This folder contains couple of mini projects that will help you to deal with Django-REST API development easily
> I thank Django & Rest API official websites along with many individual blogs, Youtube channels, relevant Stackoverflow and google links that enabled me to develop these toy projects for the purpose of learning.  -[Vatsa](vatsamail@gmail.com)

****
## Notes:
* All the mini projects are developed using 3.6.5 version
* The mini projects are located in sub folders
* Every mini project will contain its own set of requirements.txt (pip freeze) and db.sqlite3 database file
* Every mini project needs a superuser. I have used Username(admin), Email(), Password(superuser)
* The mini projects do not contain explicit documentation. The generic README.md and knowledge of Django should help you to understand the flow without any hassle.
* If you are new to Django, please refer to the following links
